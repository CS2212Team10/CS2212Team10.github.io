# UI Design
<br>
The look and feel for our web app is aimmed towards a simple and user friendly interface for everyone. The design principle we decided to follow is a flat design that will follow the guidelines stated by [Designmodo](https://designmodo.com/flat-design-principles/). With the focus on simple elements and colour to help make an elegant website to stand out above the rest.

On the top of the page in the center would display alerts to grab the users attention. This would be used to display urgent messages the user would need to check out as soon as possible. For the top left it would lead to a dropdown menu to navigate through other places on the website (refer to the image below).
