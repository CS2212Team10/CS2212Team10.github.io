I’m Paul Li, a jack-of-all trades when it comes to programming. Currently in my second year majoring in CS.

Along with my intentions in joining them later in the future, I also have quite a few hobbies. Some of my favorite include video games, board games, longboarding and browsing /r/me_irl. My responsibility is to work on the frontend to help provide elegant code from a seamless interaction between the user and the interface and with easy to read code for my fellow peers. Someone I look up to the most is Elon Musk, a risk taker, innovator and a massive impact on today’s modern technology.
